# Message board front-end
This is the front-end of an incomplete message board built on my [twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/supcole) to
learn how to properly build authentication and user systems without relying on something like Auth0. This application requires the [back-end server](https://github.com/ColeWalker/message-board) to be running as well.
